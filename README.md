# Twitter Clone

This is my first project utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is a Twitter clone where users can post tweets, follow others, and see tweets from their followers, mimicking the basic functionality of Twitter.

## Features
- Create an account and log in
- Post tweets
- Follow and unfollow users
- View a feed of tweets from followed users
- Real-time updates on the tweet feed (using sockets)

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data and tweets.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **React**: A front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for executing the back-end code.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the tutorial from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GUVz2psWUg). A special thanks to the creator for providing an excellent step-by-step guide on how to build a Twitter clone using the MERN stack.
